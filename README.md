# Amazon-Shipping-Analytics
Amazon Shipping is a company where the shipping manager doesn't have much visibility and doesn't know how many orders are processed and shipped on a monthly basis. He would like a dashboard of this where he selects a month and can tell how many orders are outstanding a day and where they should be shipped.
